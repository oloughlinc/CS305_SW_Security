This project provides security recommendations for a fictional client, Artemis Financial, who wishes to build a web application to provide financial services to clients globally. The software under review is a server skeleton running on the Spring framework, and we explore and add contributions to the code in order to improve security.

The code was checked for vulnerabilities from external libraries and found vulnerabilities were investigated and rectified if necessary. We also added the foundation for a checksum feature to ensure proper file transfer and generated a certificate for HTTPS communication. 

It is challenging to decide where to start when examining secure principles in a software application, having a flowchart of common principles is helpful to work through. One of the main lessons learned is that software security is easiest to implement from the ground up instead of adding in measures later. The end result here is a foundational program for secure internet communication.
